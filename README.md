# Halloween Countdown

#### Welcome to the Halloween Countdown! This is a beginner's project which will gradually receive new features and gimmicks, so by the time of Halloween 2023, this will be a big, dynamic website that offers entertainment even outside of the spooky season! 🦉

## 🎃 What is the vision of HC?

Well, first and foremost, I needed something to begin with. A guinea pig, so to say. I started to search for something fitting in September 2022, which ultimately led to the Halloween Countdown. Easy, right? A Counter in JavaScript. But then I thought, what a waste of a project it would be to have a website just for ... counting? So the next logical step was to create a productive and informative (and fun) website that users could benefit from all year around.

## 🔮 What does HC offer?

Well, besides the _super informative_ counter that tells you exactly how many day's there are left .. we'll have games, informative posts about the history of and around Halloween, news, super nice graphics and a guestbook (I am writing this end of Sep' 2022, so we'll see what actually makes it onto the side ...)

## 🍫 I have an idea for the website ...

Great, I am happy to hear about them! Send me a message! :D
